# Tests

It's always important to test the API, web, models etc. Down below there's a screenshot of all my tests passed.

To test it and see your coverage put this command in your **VSC** terminal
```
php artisan test --coverage
```

>[!TIP]
>If you want to see that in the html page put this command

```
  php artisan test --coverage-html=coverage-report
```

And always remeber to put it in the **VSC** terminal everytime you do new tests, so it can update the coverage.
